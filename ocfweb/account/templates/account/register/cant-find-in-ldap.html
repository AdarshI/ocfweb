            Unfortunately, we're not able to read information for this CalNet

            This often happens with alumni accounts, which the university prevents
            us from reading information about. If you get in touch with us, we
            should be able to help.

            If you believe this is an error, please <a href="{% url 'doc' 'internal/contact' %}">contact us</a>
            with your CalNet UID: <tt>{{calnet_uid}}</tt>.
