            <p>
              The OCF wants to hear from anyone who is interested in the
              possibility of participating in a free high-performance computing
              (HPC) service that we will be offering starting next academic
              year. Our eventual goal is to make intensive computational
              facilities student-run and freely avilable for all students and
              researchers in the UC Berkeley community.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our current, tentative itinerary is to make an initial hardware
              purchase by the end of the spring 2017 semester, then purchase
              additional hardware in the fall based on input from interested
              parties and feedback from a trial run in the summer or early
              fall. Depending on the success of the service after it launches
              for the entire campus, we will consider expanding it in future
              years to accommodate even more projects of varying sizes and
              needs. To that end, we have created a survey for those who might
              like to see their project run on OCF hardware:

            <p>
              To anyone who may consider hosting a current or future project on
              our open computer infrastructure, we urge you to fill out this
              survey as best as you can, using estimations if you do not have
              all the hard data. We want to see the full breadth of projects on
              campus that have unmet computing needs. Our first server is
              planned to feature multiple high-end graphics cards, a many-core
              CPU, and spacious quantities of RAM and storage, but we will need
              as much input as we can get to make informed decisions if we want
              to make high-performance computing a reality for as many as
              possible.
            </p>

              To student groups in particular, we would like to select a few
              candidates for our trial run on limited hardware. We will use our
              experience on this outing to iron out wrinkles and anticipate
              obstacles that may come up during a full run. If this sounds
              interesting to you, please let us know in your response.
