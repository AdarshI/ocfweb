            Our hard-working student volunteers (hereafter OCF staff) try to keep
            documentation plentiful and up-to-date, but it's always lagging behind.

        <p>
            We recommend starting off by reading the

            difficulties that can't be answered here, feel free to
            <a href="{% url 'doc' 'internal/contact' %}">contact us</a>.

        <h3>Staff documentation</h3>
        <p>
            If you're feeling adventurous, why not take a look at the
            <a href="{% url 'doc' 'staff' %}">technical documentation</a>
            intended for staffers?
